# Kithara

## Overview

**Website**: Kithara

**Description**: Kithara is a dynamic web e-commerce site dedicated to selling guitars and guitar accessories. This project was created as a final requirement for our course, Web Technology 2. The development of Kithara was a collaborative effort by three members, each contributing to various aspects of the site.

The primary functionalities of Kithara focus on the administration and customer management aspects, including signup, login, and database integration. While the site features a shopping cart, it currently does not support a purchasing function.

*Note*: The shopping cart feature is included but does not provide a buy function.

## Technologies Used

- **Apache NetBeans**: The integrated development environment (IDE) used for coding and debugging.
- **CSS**: For styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript (JS)**: For client-side scripting and interactivity.
- **JavaServer Pages (JSP)**: For dynamic content generation.
